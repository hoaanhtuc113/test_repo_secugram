In this edition, we’ll look at how malware tampers with the local Windows Defender AV and how you can detect it.</p><p>TL;DR for blue teams: You can use this rule as an early indicator of a potential compromise. At the very least, someone is weakening your defenses. </p><p>TL;DR for red teams: Avoid using the PowerShell APIs for disabling the Defender AV.</p><p>Cross post from medium.com, please read the full article here:</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this edition of FalconFriday, we are going to revisit process injection techniques. We’ve covered process injection in a previous blog post; this one is an extension to cover other process injection techniques.</p><p>TL;DR for blue teams: The two rules in this blog provide you with (indicators of) process injection techniques that are not natively detected by Defender for Endpoint.</p><p>TL;DR for red teams: We’re trying to push you to start using more obscure process injection techniques. Injections with QueueUserApcand explicitly allocating memory in remote processes are being detected by these two rules.</p>]]></content:encoded>
